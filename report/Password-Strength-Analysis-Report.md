## 🛠️ Password Creation & Evaluation

| Password                    | Tool Used                  | Score/Feedback                   | Estimated Crack Time     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `password123`               | passwordmeter.com          | Weak – common pattern            | Seconds                   |
| `P@ssw0rd2025`              | howsecureismypassword.net  | Moderate – predictable structure | Hours                     |
| `T!m3$h1ft#X9z`             | Kaspersky Password Checker | Strong – good entropy            | Centuries                 |
| `gR8!_V@ult$2k25#`          | passwordmeter.com          | Very Strong – excellent mix      | Millions of years         |
| `MyDogEats$ocks@Midnight`  | howsecureismypassword.net  | Strong – long passphrase         | Billions of years         |

## 📊 Analysis & Best Practices

- **Length matters**: Aim for 12+ characters.
- **Complexity is key**: Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- **Avoid predictability**: No dictionary words, names, or common patterns.
- **Use passphrases**: Memorable yet strong (e.g., `MyDogEats$ocks@Midnight`).
- **Test your passwords**: Use multiple strength checkers for validation.
- **Consider password managers**: They help generate and store secure passwords.
